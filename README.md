# lektor-scss
A very simple scss builder for Lektor because you do not always need all of webpack

To use it, drop it in the `package` folder in your Lektor project and create a `scss` folder in the root of your lektor project.
All `.scss` and `.sass` files are automaticaly compiled and put in your `assets/static` folder.
